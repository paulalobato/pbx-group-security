Security Operation Center - SOC Planning

So, I think now that we have a good team in place, the time is come to really start defining the objectives and the structure, and how the things should work.

So, basically, the team that we have in place now is Francois, with sticking edition position. James, providing some management and technical expertise. And then we have the Up personal part of the team made of Vlad, Naushad and Ian.
 
And then, we have Steffen, helping with the project management of this. What is very important next is to define the roles and responsibilities of each of the team members and what are they accountable for. Especially, because some of them are timed. One of the areas that Steffen needs to help is the definition of the projects that actually the socs are going to be involved. Because, actually, what you have is one main project, which is probably the creation of the SOC, and then any of the SOCs, and then individual sub-projects, to handle specific items that people are working on. Namely, how you handle incidents? So, they have so individualization activities, managing some of the tools, they actually have projects itself.

One of the things that we need to map is, also, our deliverables, what we want to deliver the next couple of months, figuring the specifics of doing this, and all this should probably ideally condense in a kind of reset package pieces, which you can then pack into a presentation for me and for Richard, especially for the discussions that needs to happen very soon about how the SOC and the NOC is all going to interact together.
So, here, I also what to start looking at the pin-points that we have and think about them. I'd say at the moment pinpoints are we don't have visibility of what is happening in our environment. We need to handle our incidents much better, and in a much more efficient way, and define who does what, what sequence of events, and what happens when, who is responsible for. For example, for this meltdown vulnerability that we weren't really that involved, which is kind good news is techops, you know, raised the occasion, but we should be more involved, providing a lot more information. 

And of course, the other big one is what is happening with the factories. I don't think we still have a good grip on that incident. And basically, we still have a massive backlog of events that we have from DocTrace, from traffic and from mac-mine, we need to make sure we handle all of those. And, we need to start planning for our demanding meeting. So, there are mandatory meetings for incidents, that should actually be followed up by reports I have to present at the directorsâ€™ meetings that happens from 11:30, so I should also provide an update. So, there is also the farm, which is the update to the business, which also we should have our data. So, you guys need to take a look what is the data that we are preparing and make sure that it helps, take at least a variation of those. 

We also have still some recruiting going on. We still need to recruit a couple of new people and involve a couple more resources into this, and we need to create a plan for what is going to happen with the discussions that we do NOC, which is going to happen in the next couple of weeks. Which is basically how that is going to work, and I'd like us to be in a position where we can take responsibility for it and we basically start taking responsibilities for the NOC, but for that we need to be in a much better position, have much better handling of our processes and workflows, which at the moment, we don't. 
So, can you guys take a look at this and then, come back to me? And then, let's take this to the next level.
