Whose problem is this anyway?

A problem shared is a problem halved
There is something comforting about sharing an issue. Simply telling the tale to an understanding ear can somehow expand the cognitive space your own brain assigned to the problem. This can catalyse the formulation of the solution without your listener offering any opinions or insights themselves.
There is a world of difference, however, between asking another intelligent mind to listen to you discuss your problem and trying to pass that problem on. A problem thrown to someone else is a problem that may not be solved effectively. 

A hot potato
There are problems that get passed around like a hot potato being thrown from hand to hand. Unless someone takes ownership, they can keep moving, or worse, they may settle in the lap of someone who does not comprehend the complexities of the issue. 
When you pass a problem on you are delegating. Delegation is essential to human economics, a software developer simply does not have time to grow all the vegetables they will need to sustain themselves through the long, pre-deadline nights. They delegate that responsibility to people they never meet, the farmers. Throwing your responsibilities at someone else is not, however, delegating. In fact, such hand-offs can affect the economics of the situation. Always be aware of the difference between effective delegation and responsibility dumping. Have you asked for somebody else to solve a problem that, fundamentally, should be solved by you?

Hidden communication costs
Imagine that each person can complete 5 units of work in a given time. If you add another person to the project the total work done will increase, but it will not double. In fact, as much as 1/5 of the units available will be spent on coordination. Therefore 2 people can contribute 8 units, not ten.
This communication cost is paid time and again in meetings across the world. Project managers thrive on knowing what is going on. That is why you are invited to the weekly or daily catch ups. Many companies now recognize that such meetings can be a hindrance, a meeting with an agenda “catch up” should be rejected by all involved. There are other ways to keep your Project Managers informed and up to date, be aware of communication costs and challenge them. 
Cost/benefit communication
Each coordination between parties can be thrown into one of two piles. The communication created attrition or growth. Before you and reach out to a colleague, take a breath and ask yourself which pile will this land in? Instead of distributing the cost of doing something, can you fix it right here, right now? 
Communications with colleagues and customers should contain the hint of the reverence of the boy scouts’ camp site: always leave them in a better state than when you arrived. There are ways to make the other part of the team, the other part of the company or the customer, better off and you must be ready to accept when that includes not interacting at all.
